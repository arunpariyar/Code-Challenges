// if yes show the contact on the list
// if not mention that the contact cannot be found

//Things to be addressed now
// 1. clearing values when button is submitted - done
// 2. styles - done
// 3. checking if the program core can be made private using ifie - beyond context of this project
// 4. question is it okay to have two list to hold contacts ? - I belive it is
// 5. Event propagation was very helpful must surely go in the documentation for the project
// 6. Need to add a view all contacts button - perhaps just a reload implementation in the button will do
// 7. Start with the design in figma proceed with the next steps

//STYLES TO DO
// have default info in the input tags - DONE **
// figure out how to put icon inside the input tags - DONE ** suitable alternative found
// insert the plus sign next to the title and get the contact submission to show and hide - DONE

//REFACTORING

// May be think about breaking the function in smaller parts if possible.
// for example to capitalise the name
